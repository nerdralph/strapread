# strapread
AMD GCN BIOS strap reader

I am no longer maintaining this since another utility was released shortly after mine.

strapmod.py is still useful to do simple timinging optimizations.
My focus for future development is runtime timing tweaking with no BIOS flashing required.
My fork of amdmeminfo can be used to show timing at runtime, and will be updated to allow modifications.
